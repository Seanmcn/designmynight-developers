# Updates sent from Tevalis to Collins:

* Walk-ins

* Transferring the table on the EPOS with a booking assigned will also transfer the booking in Collins. Validation occurs to ensure there is not another booking on the table before the transfer is complete. 

* Merging tables onto a table with a booking open will extend the booking on Collins onto the same table range. Unmerge also contains the same functionality. When a booking is opened, if it is for multiple tables then the merging will be done automatically on the POS.

* Stage of the booking
