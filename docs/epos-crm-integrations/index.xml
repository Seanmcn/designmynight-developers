      <description>Collins/Fishbowl Integration Overview The Collins/Fishbowl integration is set up so that when new customers/bookings are added to Collins, they will automatically push to Fishbowl (if the customer has opted in for your marketing permission).

Please note: depending on our tech roadmap, it can take our tech team up to two weeks to set up this integration.</description>
