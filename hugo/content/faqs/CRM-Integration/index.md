## Collins/Fishbowl Integration Overview

The Collins/Fishbowl integration is set up so that when new customers/bookings are added to Collins, they will automatically push to Fishbowl (if the customer has opted in for  your marketing permission).

## Setting up the Collins/Fishbowl Integration

If you are looking to set up an integration with Fishbowl, please request your **Quick Subscribe Documentation** from Fishbowl and pass on to your Collins Account Manager. 

Please note that this can take our tech team up to two weeks to set up for you. 

Once set up, data should be pushed to Fishbowl whenever a user is created/changes (in most cases, this will be when the booking is added).
So if you would like to test the integration, you can create a test booking in your Collins (and check that they are showing in Fishbowl).
